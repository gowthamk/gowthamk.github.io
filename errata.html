The type of list filter function given in the paper is wrong. Here is
its correct type:

(R1) filter : l -> (x -> {v | ([v=true] => (R1(x) = {()}))
                           /\ ([v=false] => (R1(x) = {(x)})) }) 
  -> {v | Rmem[RId](v) = Rmem[R1](l)};

Specs for filter, and other list functions are found here:
