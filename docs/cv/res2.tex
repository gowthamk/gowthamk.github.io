\section{Research}
 {\bf Relational Framework for Higher-order Shape Analysis} \\
 (With Suresh Jagannathan) Devised a verification framework based on
 decidable relational logics to automatically reason about
 catamorphisms in ML-like languages. The framework manifests as a
 dependent type system for ML and scales to higher-order programs by
 assigning "very general" (although not principal) types to
 higher-order functions. Our experience so far suggests that the
 method is quite useful to automatically verify partial correctness
 properties of compiler transformations. The current implementation of
 the framework is available online. Work-in-progress presentations
 have been delivered at 
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space
 \item Higher-Order Program Analysis (HOPA) Workshop, New Orleans,
 28th-29th June, 2013.
 \item Mid-west Verification Day (MVD), Chicago, 20th-21st September,
 2013.
 \end{itemize}

{\bf A Novel Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm for Computational Grids}\\
(With S. Bansal, and Chittaranjan Hota) Devised a de-centralized
dynamic load balancing algorithm for efficient task scheduling in
computational grids.

 \item IEEE conference on Internet Multimedia Systems Architecture and
 Applications (IMSAA), Bangalore, India, 2009.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Professional \\ Experience}
{\bf Software Engineer, Yahoo SDC, Bangalore, India} \hfill August, 2009 -
July, 2011\\
Frontend engineering for Yahoo content platforms group. Developed AJAX
and php tools for querying, processing and presenting
loosely-structured data from various content grids inside yahoo. The
tools were used by Yahoo's content curators.

{\bf Engineering intern, Qualcomm, Hyderabad, India} \hfill January,
2009 - June, 2009\\
QA Engineering for Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) -
User interface module (UIM) group. Developed tools to test low-level
mobile network code.
