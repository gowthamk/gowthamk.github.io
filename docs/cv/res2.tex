\section{Professional \\ Experience}

{\bf Research Intern, Microsoft Research India, Bangalore} \\
(May - August, 2014 \& July-August, 2015) 
Built a region type system and region type inference to ensure the
safety of dataflow programs that rely on programmer-managed memory
regions, instead of garbage collection for memory management.

{\bf Software Engineer, Yahoo SDC, Bangalore, India} \hfill August, 2009 -
July, 2011\\
Frontend engineering for Yahoo content platforms group. Developed AJAX
and php tools for querying, processing and presenting
loosely-structured data from various content grids inside yahoo. The
tools were used by Yahoo's content curators.

{\bf Engineering intern, Qualcomm, Hyderabad, India} \hfill January - June, 2009\\
QA Engineering for Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) -
User interface module (UIM) group. Developed tools to test low-level
mobile network code.
