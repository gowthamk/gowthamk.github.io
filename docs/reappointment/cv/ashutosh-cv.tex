\heading{G. Refereed Publications in Proceedings}

\vspace{1em}
In many areas of Computer Science, including theoretical computer science, the first and primary publication venues are full length papers
in the proceedings of selective conferences. 
Many conferences have extensive two-phase review processes with author
responses. The two main outlets are proceedings published 
by ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) series published by Springer. The DBLP service
(http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/) maintains an up-to-date index of Computer Science
literature. In the following, the  $\dag$ mark indicates students or post-doctoral
reseachers that I formally advise, and the $\ddag$ mark indicates other student
co-authors.
Also, in theoretical computer science publications, author ordering is typically
by alphabetical order---most of my paper follow this norm.
