Few research problems where I am actively seeking student involvement
are described below (in no particular order). 

<h2> Distributed Program Verification and Synthesis</h2>

Distributed systems are workhorses of internet-era computing. While
distributed computing has become ubiquitous, the complexity of
programming however has remained high, resulting in deep and subtle
bugs that are sometimes be exploited to the detriment of
safety-critical systems. Verification preempts most such bugs by
producing a machine-certified proof that the system satisfies its
specification, however the cost of manual verification remains
exceedingly high. Modelchecking (Ã  la TLA+) is a low-cost
mostly-automated alternative to verification, but modelchecking is
effective only on specifications (or model implementations), leaving
open the possibility of bugs in real implementations. In this context,
it is pertinent to ask the following question:


> Is there a non-trivial sub-class of distributed programs for which
> we can construct a mostly-automated verification procedure? How
> effective would the verification be in practice?

Alternatively, one might ask similar question in the context of
synthesis: 

> Is there a non-trivial sub-class of distributed programs that can
> be synthesized from their (declarative) specifications? How
> competent are the synthesized programs in practice?

These research questions are relevant not only to the commercial
distributed computing enterprise, but also to the future of
internet-scale computing in general. As people gradually move away
from trusting few large corporations with their data and computation,
large-scale decentralized architectures (e.g., blockchains) and
local-first software become the norm. In this context, it is
worthwhile to pursue the dream of a programming framework that lets
individuals own their data and help them deploy local-first
decentralized software with the same ease as they deploy centralized
cloud-hosted software today.

<h2> Probabilistic Verification of Systems </h2>

Conventional program verification answers a yes-or-no question: given
a program and a machine, is it provably *safe* to execute the program
on the machine? Safety is generally defined as machine never reaching
an undesirable state or never getting *stuck*. Unfortunately, real
systems are fraught with uncertainties such as network partitions,
message losses, and disk crashes, and proving safety under such system
model requires programmers to account for black swan events through
expensive mitigations (e.g., strengthening the consistency model,
adding locks etc). An interesting alternative in this context is to
change the nature of verification itself:

> Instead of performing deterministic reasoning, can a program
> verification be formulated based on a probabilistic reasoning about
> program safety? Instead of giving a yes-or-no answer, can the
> verification  establish numeric bounds on how much a system
> deviates from its safety condition?

Such a probabilistic verification framework could be useful in the
context of applications such as online banking and e-commerce, where a
slight deviation from safety condition is admissable in the interest
of performance and ease of use, provided that such a deviation is
quantifiable.

<h2> Program Reconstruction from Traces </h2>

{% include image.html url="/images/program_reconstruction.png" width=350 align="left" %}

Program synthesis is the task of synthesizing programs from various
kinds of specifications, such as declarations in a formal logic
specifying the program semantics, input-output examples describing the
program's I/O behavior, or execution traces capturing main events in
the program's execution. While synthesis based on logical
specifications and input-output examples has received much attention
in the research literature, trace-based synthesis has not elicited
similar enthusiasm due to its limited applicability; traces are hard
to generate without the program, and if a program exists then there is
likely no need for synthesis. This is however not true in case of
Program Reconstruction, which remains a major application of
trace-based synthesis. Under Program Reconstruction, one attempts to
*reconstruct* a program, whose source code is inaccessible, by
observing a collection of its execution traces. Program Reconstruction
has been used for digital forensics in the context of database
applications, but the formal guarantees of such reconstruction remain
an open question. Nonetheless, I believe there is much scope for
exploring Program Reconstruction in the context of Machine Learning
applications, where, if successful, reconstruction could lead to
significant reductions in the model generation time.
